# Doxygen documentation

Doxygen configuration is in the [Doxyfile](Doxyfile). Adjust the following options for your project:

- `PROJECT_NAME`
- `PROJECT_NUMBER`
- `PROJECT_BRIEF`
- `PROJECT_LOGO`
- `INPUT`

The `doxywizard` tool can help to configure doxygen using a graphical interface:

```sh
$ doxywizard Doxyfile
```
